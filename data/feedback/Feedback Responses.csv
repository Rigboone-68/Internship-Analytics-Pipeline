For instance, an orientation or clearer overview of project expectations would have helped me get started more efficiently. Additionally, having more regular check-ins or opportunities to discuss progress would be useful for ensuring alignment and continued learning. Some of the provided materials felt a bit general, so tailoring resources more closely to specific projects could make them more helpful.",Ashna,5,Always available and accurate,5
